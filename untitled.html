<div>Introduction (Dilan)<br></div><div>Biorefinery is an integrated processing facility
where biomass is converted into a variety of products ranging from fuels to value-added
chemicals after many physical, chemical and thermal conversion technologies
with minimal waste and emissions. In a biorefinery, a variety of feedstocks,
products and a large number of technologies exist and this brings challenges
for the developers while considering economic performance, energy requirement
and environmental impact simultaneously. A systematic approach for the design
of biorefinery integrates the use of advanced process synthesis, process
analysis and optimization methods <cite class="squire-citation ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@inbook{antonis,

produce energetically and economically efficient process flowsheets with good

biorefineries are likely to play significant roles in enhancing the energy
security and mitigating the climate changes. Process modeling and simulation
are essential for predicting the economic, environomic and social performance
of industrial processes. In the recent past, researchers are mainly focusing on
the development of cost-effective biorefineries that can only be achieved by
optimal mass and energy integrations. In order to make the bio-refinery profitable,
production of value added products (e.g., succinic acid, dimethyl ether, etc.),
valorization of waste mass and energy streams, and cogeneration are
significantly important. If biorefinery is only producing biofuels,
environmental incentives may be required. The sustainable growth of biorefinery
not only requires cost-effective products, but also energy efficient plants.
The environomic assessment of biorefinery includes land use change, greenhouse
gas emission, timing of emission, waste production, environmental impact of
product, etc. Some studies in literature are specifically focusing on the
life-cycle assessment of biorefineries (Ahlgren et al., 2015).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div>Biorefinery can use many traditional
equipment from the petrochemical industry (e.g., distillation column, pump,
heat exchange, compressors, etc.), and cost functions for these equipment are
well established (Turton et al., 2009). Conversely, some of the biorefinery
processes are underdevelopment (e.g., gasifier, fuel cell, membrane separation,
etc.), so their future costs are highly uncertain (Caliandro, 2014). Generally,
production cost goes down with an increase in the plant size, and optimal plant
capacity depends on economic value of product. Since biomass is diluted and
diversified in vast area, so supply chain optimization and economic viability
study for different sizes of biorefineries is also critical for investment
planning. &nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Optimization (Shivom)<br></div><div>The development of novel
products from biorefineries usually focus the conversion of biomass, selection
of reaction pathway and maximum reaction yield. After that, different
conversion and separation steps are included to form a biorefinery superstructure.
The biorefinery superstructure can be optimized for different performance
objectives such as total cost and carbon dioxide emissions (Celebi et al.,
2016). The optimization algorithm may generate different biorefinery
configurations <i>via</i> product and
technology selection, energy and mass integration, depending on the objective
of interest, raw material and utility costs, and product price. Gebreslassie et
al. (2012) have considered multi-objective and multi-period optimization of biorefinery
supply chains under supply and demand uncertainties. Geraili et al (2015) used
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to quantify the tradeoffs between cost
and financial risk for biorefineries. Stuart and El-Halwagi (2012) examined the
integration of biorefineries into existing processes and infrastructure.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div>
