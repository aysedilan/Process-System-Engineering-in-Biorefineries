where biomass is converted into a variety of products ranging from fuels to value-added
chemicals after many physical, chemical and thermal conversion technologies, with minimal waste and emissions. In a biorefinery, variety of feedstocks, many products and large number of technologies exist, and this brings great challenges to the process developers while considering economic performance, energy requirement
and environmental impact simultaneously. A systematic approach, for the design
of biorefinery, integrates the use of advanced process synthesis, process
analysis and optimization methods (<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@inbook{antonis,

synthesis methods collect the input data about the biorefinery processes and
produce energetically and economically efficient process flowsheets with good
operating conditions and design specifications. Process modelling and
simulation are complementary approaches to analyse the different designs obtained from

abstract  =&quot;An optimization-based process synthesis framework is proposed for the thermochemical conversion of biomass to liquid fuels (BTL). Gasification of biomass is used to generate synthesis gas which can be converted to raw hydrocarbons either directly using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or indirectly using catalytic conversion of methanol over ZSM-5. Multiple technologies are considered for generation of the raw hydrocarbons including (i) six types of Fischer-Tropsch units with different temperatures{,} catalyst types{,} and hydrocarbon effluent compositions{,} (ii) methanol conversion using methanol-to-gasoline{,} and (iii) methanol conversion using methanol-to-olefins. The hydrocarbons are upgraded into the final liquid fuel products (i.e.{,} gasoline{,} diesel{,} and kerosene) using one or more technologies including ZSM-5 catalytic conversion{,} oligomerization{,} hydrocracking{,} isomerization{,} alkylation{,} and hydrotreating. A simultaneous heat{,} power{,} and water integration is included within the process synthesis framework to directly examine the costs associated with utility production and wastewater treatment with a particular topological design. A rigorous global optimization branch-and-bound strategy is implemented to mathematically guarantee the development of a BTL refinery that is economically and environmentally superior to all competing designs. Twenty-four case studies are investigated to determine the effect of refinery capacity{,} liquid fuel composition{,} and biomass feedstock on the overall system cost{,} the BTL refinery topological design{,} the process material/energy balances{,} and the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.&quot;}

results in economics optimization. In hierarchical approach, one can decide
whether the plant will be operated in batch or continuous, type of reactor
used, recycle schemes for material, methods and sequence of seperations, energy integration applied, etc. In thermodynamic analysis,
one has to decide the units and streams which are included in the pinch
analysis, thermodynamic targets used and the level of utilities are involved.
In optimization approach, extent of the superstructure, included physical data,
employed objective function, constraints and uncertainties to consider, are the features to be decided by engineer (<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@book{seferlis2004integration,

Process Design</b><br></div><div>In the context of process synthesis, process models are necessary for simulating process flowsheets. Mathematical model is used in process simulation that represents the behavior of the process. A mathematical
process model consists a set of variables which describes important properties of the
process and a set of equations that builds relationships among variables to
explain the behavior of the process. For complex systems
found in  chemical industry, the process models represent mostly nonlinear behaviors. With the
increased interest in process synthesis, the demand for process models with increased accuracy  is also growing. One important concept in process system engineering is superstructure optimization. A superstructure contains most (or all) of the system alternatives. Superstructures are defined by the process modeller, and alternative
superstructures can be derived for the same process. Then, mathematical optimization
approach seeks to find the optimal configuration among the proposed alternatives (<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article {CITE201400037,

is applicable into industrial processes where mass exchange occurs between process streams
in a number of process units such as extractors, absorbers. They considered the transfer of
only a single contaminant from a rich stream to a lean stream where a rich stream has a
higher concentration of contaminant while a lean stream represents a stream with a
lower concentration of the contaminant. The target in this study was to minimize fresh
water flow rate. Mass pinch can be applied in the area of wastewater minimization where the
water and wastewater is optimally used by reuse, regeneration and recycling. Wang

biorefineries are likely to play significant roles in enhancing the energy
security and mitigating the climate changes. Process modeling and simulation
are essential for predicting the economic, environomic and social performance
of industrial processes. In the recent past, researchers are mainly focusing on
the development of cost-effective biorefineries that can only be achieved by
optimal mass and energy integrations. In order to make the bio-refinery profitable,
production of value added products (e.g., succinic acid, dimethyl ether, etc.),
valorization of waste mass and energy streams, and cogeneration are
significantly important. If biorefinery is only producing biofuels,
environmental incentives may be required. The sustainable growth of biorefinery
not only requires cost-effective products, but also energy efficient plants.
The environomic assessment of biorefinery includes land use change, greenhouse
gas emission, timing of emission, waste production, environmental impact of
product, etc. Some studies in literature are specifically focusing on the
life-cycle assessment of biorefineries (Ahlgren et al., 2015).<br></div><div>Biorefinery can use many traditional
equipment from the petrochemical industry (e.g., distillation column, pump,
heat exchange, compressors, etc.), and cost functions for these equipment are
well established (Turton et al., 2009). Conversely, some of the biorefinery
processes are underdevelopment (e.g., gasifier, fuel cell, membrane separation,
etc.), so their future costs are highly uncertain (Caliandro, 2014). Generally,
production cost goes down with an increase in the plant size, and optimal plant
capacity depends on economic value of product. Since biomass is diluted and
diversified in vast area, so supply chain optimization and economic viability
study for different sizes of biorefineries is also critical for investment
planning. &nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>6. Optimization</b><br></div><div>The development of novel
products from biorefineries usually focus the conversion of biomass, selection
of reaction pathway and maximum reaction yield. After that, different
conversion and separation steps are included to form a biorefinery superstructure.
The biorefinery superstructure can be optimized for different performance
objectives such as total cost and carbon dioxide emissions (Celebi et al.,
2016). The optimization algorithm may generate different biorefinery
configurations <i>via</i> product and
technology selection, energy and mass integration, depending on the objective
of interest, raw material and utility costs, and product price. Gebreslassie et
al. (2012) have considered multi-objective and multi-period optimization of biorefinery
supply chains under supply and demand uncertainties. Geraili et al (2015) used
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to quantify the tradeoffs between cost
and financial risk for biorefineries. Stuart and El-Halwagi (2012) examined the
integration of biorefineries into existing processes and infrastructure.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>7. Case Study : SNG production from microalgae through hydrothermal gasification</b><br></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Mian_2015,

Each Pareto optimal solution shows a different optimal configuration. Figure 2 shows the Pareto frontier and the selected optimal solutions for analyzing the effects of decision variables on the optimal designs. Table 1 presents the optimal values of decision variables for three selected optimal configurations.
