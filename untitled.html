biorefineries are likely to play significant roles in enhancing the energy
security and mitigating the climate changes. Process modeling and simulation
are essential for predicting the economic, environomic and social performance
of industrial processes. In the recent past, researchers are mainly focusing on
the development of cost-effective biorefineries that can only be achieved by
optimal mass and energy integrations. In order to make the bio-refinery profitable,
production of value added products (e.g., succinic acid, dimethyl ether, etc.),
valorization of waste mass and energy streams, and cogeneration are significantly
important. If biorefinery is only producing biofuels, environmental incentives
may be required. The sustainable growth of biorefinery not only requires
cost-effective products, but also energy efficient plants. The environomic
assessment of biorefinery includes land use change, greenhouse gas emission,
timing of emission, waste production, environmental impact of product, etc. Some
studies in literature are specifically focusing the life-cycle assessment of
biorefineries (Ahlgren et al., 2015). &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></div><div>Biorefinery can use many traditional equipment from the
petroleum refinery (e.g., distillation column, pump, heat exchange, compressors,
etc.), and cost functions for these equipment are well established (Turton et
al., 2009). Some of the biorefinery processes are underdevelopment (e.g., gasifier,
fuel cell, membrane separation, etc.), so their future costs are highly
uncertain (Caliandro, 2014). Generally, production cost goes down with an
increase in the plant size. Since biomass is diluted and diversified in vast
area, so supply chain optimization and feasibility study for different sizes of
biorefineries is also critical for investment planning.
